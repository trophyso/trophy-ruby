# Trophy Ruby SDK

The Trophy Ruby SDK provides convenient access to the Trophy API from applications written in the
Ruby language. 

Trophy provides APIs and tools for adding gamification to your application, keeping users engaged 
through rewards, achievements, streaks, and personalized communication.

## Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the gem. If you just want to use the 
package, just run:

```bash
gem install trophy
```

If you want to build the gem from source:

```bash
gem build trophy.gemspec
```

## Usage

The package needs to be configured with your account's API key which is available in the Trophy
dashboard.

```ruby

```

## Documentation

See the [Trophy API Docs](https://trophy.docs.buildwithfern.com/overview/introduction) for more
information on the accessible endpoints.
